#### Roman-Numeral-Decimal-Converter ####

Write a simple program that converts a user input Roman Numeral to an Integer.

This project came about from an online challenge to write the program in as many different languages as possible.
The eventual aim will be to have as many in the repo as I can.

Contained in the repo is an image file of Roman Numerals and their relevant integer. Please base all code on this reference.

All collaborations welcome. Any language of your choice.

The aim of the program is to firstly explain the roman numeral system and what each numeral represents numericaly.
It then asks the user to input a numeral which they wish to convert to an integer.
Once executed, the programme will output the interger. If a valid numeral is not entered the user will be told and the program
will stop.

This project will be continually checked for requestes.
